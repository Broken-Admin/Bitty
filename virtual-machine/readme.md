## C-Sim, a C implementation of the Bitty virtual machine

- TODO
    - "ROM" file loading
    - Opcode and operand parsing
    - Instruction execution
    - 2-bit address RAM

- Possible modifications to Bitty
    - Design a 2-bit ALU, adding RAM[1] and RAM[2] together, and effectively making RAM[3] a ROM address
