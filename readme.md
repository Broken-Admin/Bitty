# Bitty, a 2-bit computer
- This is the VM for the Bitty 2-bit Minecraft computer
- See docs/ for more information
- Bitty does not currently include an assembler and all programs must be written in machine-code, directly to the binary file. A pen and paper or notepad tool is recommended for writing and debugging of programs.
